## Notes Elena
main.dart:
The app is created and started.
Add named paths for new pages here.
Has structure setup for login work/fail and a loading circle that we can use with real login.

auth.dart
This must be connected to Firebase

login.dart
Login screen that is the first thing to see now

social_distancing.dart
The first screen for questions. We should add a model for the answers.

WIP
- localization. I tried to make it work but couldn't yet in the "easy" way I wanted. Also the folder i18n belongs to that experiment.
- home.dart is just a test class, but it contains the logout button and I thought we might add it somewhere
